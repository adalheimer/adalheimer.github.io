  title={"They Just Don't Get Us": Perceived Misunderstanding as a Driver of Affective Polarization and Avoidance Behavior},
  author={Alexander Dalheimer, Markus Wagner},
  abstract={Prior research has identified partisan meta-perceptions as a potential source of partisan animosity. Building on this work, we introduce a concept that extends beyond perceived like and dislike: perceived understanding. Perceived understanding refers to the perception of how well out-partisans understand in-party voters' values, motives and intentions, and way of life. We expect the more people perceive their co-partisans to be misunderstood by out-party supporters, the more they will be affectively polarized, hostile, and avoidant toward out-partisans.
  <br/>
  This paper uses three sources of data. First, original cross-sectional survey data from 13 countries is used to examine the prevalence of the perception that in-party supporters are misunderstood and how this correlates with key outcomes. Second, an experimental cognitive interview study in the US shows respondents' top-of-the-head considerations when answering our key survey questions. This will provide further evidence that the concept of perceived understanding differs from meta-perceptions. Third, a conjoint experiment assesses the causal effect of perceived (mis)understanding on affective evaluations and action tendencies. Through simultaneous manipulation of the perception of being misunderstood and meta-perceptions, the experiment aims not only to establish causality but also to demonstrate the distinct nature of these two concepts. The cross-sectional results indicate strong associations between perceived (mis)understanding, affective polarization, and avoidance tendency. 
  <br/>
  This project contributes to the ongoing research on partisan conflict by shedding light on the role of perceived (mis)understanding in shaping inter-group dynamics. The findings can inform targeted countermeasures to mitigate affective polarization and prevent further escalation of partisan animosity.},
