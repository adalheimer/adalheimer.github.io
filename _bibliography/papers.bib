  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Classification of Credit Worthiness: A Neural Network Approach},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={The assessment of credit worthiness is one of the oldest but still most important objectives of commercial banks and financial institutions. The prediction of the risk of default of an loan applicant is still a hot debated topic in the economic literature because a misclassification of someone as credit worthy is associated with high costs for the financial institute in case of a default. In this research project I apply a feedforward neural network in order to discriminate between credit worthy and not credit worthy costumers based on data by the company Lending Club. For a comparison of the network's performance, a logistic regression with lasso penalty is computed as benchmark. The findings are surprising since the neural network does perform similarly as the logisitic regression but has much higher computational costs. Therefore, I conclude to prefer logistic regression over simple feedforward neural network.},

  title={Road Traffic Fatalities: The Effect of the Implementation of the 'accompanied driving from the age of 17' in Germany},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={Especially for young people in rural areas, a driving licence is an essential improvement of autonomy and mobility. In many countries the legal driving age is eighteen. However, some countries, e.g. Germany and France, allow the acquisition of a driver's license already with seventeen years. Germany implemented in 2011 a law called 'Begleitetes Fahren mit 17' (BF17) which allows a new driver to drive a car accompanied by a registered and experienced driver. In this project the causal effect of the implementation of the policy (BF17) on the road traffic fatalities under the new young drivers (18-24 years old) is investigated. The research question of this project is: Did the impelemtation of BF17 lead to a decrease of the road traffic fatalities under the 18-24 years old drivers? Synthetic control method is used to estimate the causal effect of the policy. By using this method it is possible to compare the actual observed trend of road traffic fatalities with a synthetic counterfactual trend. The results indicate that there is no significant effect of the policy on the road traffic fatalities.},

  title={Reinforced Islamophobia and Xenophobia after the Terror Attack of Charlie Hebdo? An Analysis using Regression Discontinuity Design},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={In the year 2015 two brothers stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Coincidentially, at the time of the terror attack the seventh wave of the European Social Survey was in progress. This offers the possibility to analyze the respondent's attitudes towards immigration and Muslims before and after the terror attack of Charlie Hebdo. This research project has not the aim to develop or test theory. Rather it just aims to analyze if the terror attack had an causal impact on the attitudes of the French respondents. More precisely, it will be tested if the terror attack reinforced islamophobia and xenophobia. For this purpose a regression discontinuity design is chosen. In order to increase the asymptotic covariance some socio-demographic covariates and one proxy for tolerance are included in three different models. The results of the regression discontinuity indicate that the terror attack had no relevant negative impact on the attitudes towards immigration and Muslims. Actually, it is shown that the tolerance towards more immigration even increased of the respondents which were interviewed after the terror attack.},

  title={Determinants for Intra-Party Heterogeneity of parliamentary Speech Complexity},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={The parliament plays a crucial role in representational democracies since it is the place where elected representatives discuss policies and communicate their positions not only to fellow party members and colleagues of other parties but also to constituents (Proksch and Slapin, 2014; Martin and Vanberg, 2008). However, parliamentary debates are still understudied (Proksch and Slapin, 2012). This project aims to study one specific rhetorical aspect of debates which is speech complexity. Speeches can become cheap talk if citizens cannot understand the core messages of their representatives which can have severe implications for the quality of democracy. Thus, this project has two objectives: (1) the assessment of within and between party variation in speech complexity and (2) the identification of determinants of speech complexity. It is argued that not party affiliation but MP characteristics determine how complex speeches are. By using the LÃ¤sbarhetsindex (LIX) and the Flesch-Kinkaid score to measure the complexity of speeches from the 19. German Bundestag, evidence is presented that there is low variation between parties but high variation within parties. In subsequent analyses, the effects of potential determinants are estimated with linear-mixed effect models. The results show that speech complexity is associated with either little experience or high experience of MPs. Furthermore, speeches of parliamentary secretaries are more complex than those of ministers, party leaders or MPs holding other positions. On the party level, speeches of MPs from government parties are associated with higher speech complexity than speeches of members of opposition parties.},

  title={Generational Conflicts regarding individuel Policy Prefereferences for governmental Healthcare Spending? A Comparison of 21 OECD Countries},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={This short research paper addresses the on-going debate about the 'coming war of generations' which goes back on Browning (1975), Campbell (1980) and Downs (1957). Part of the literature expects a growing generational conflict based on age-related differences of policy preferences. In this project age-related preferences for healtcare expenditures are measured and tested. The theoretical fundament of this study is a classical rational choice framework from which hypotheses are derived. First, a descriptive mean comparison of the preferences of retired and non-retired persons is conducted. This analysis reveals that preferences are different between retirees and non-retirees but not systematically. There are large country-related differences in the magnitude of the differences but also in the direction of the differences. In some countries retirees have stronger preferences for healthcare spending than the non-retirees while in other countries the opposite can be observed. Second, a linear regression model with clustered standard errors is used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data. However, the regression shows only a few significant effects. Finally, a cleavage measure is used to test if there is a sign for a generational conflict. While the average cleavage intensity is not high, there are large country-related difference of the cleavage intensity.},

  title={Preferences for redistributive Policies in the Context of Demographic Change: Explanation of Country-related Differences for Pension Policy},
  author={Dalheimer, Alexander},
  abstract={This study is an excerpt of my Bachelor thesis and is only available in German language. The aim of this paper is to investigate if there are age-related differences of preferences towards pension spending. Furthermore, a age-cleavage measurement is used in order to test if there is an age cleavage at all, and if so, how strong it is. This research question addresses the on-going debate about the 'coming war of generations' which goes back on Browning (1975), Campbell (1980) and Downs (1957). Part of the literature expects a growing generational conflict based on age-related differences of policy preferences. This paper is restricted to the investigation of pension spending preferences which can be assumed - under a classical rational choice framework - to have potential for age-related different preferences. Moreover, detected country-related differences of preferences are tried to explain by further analysis. Besides the cleavage measurement which is based on 22 OLS-regressions, linear multi-level models with cross-level interaction effects are used in order to explain the country-related differences. The results indicate age-related differences considering pension spending preferences. Country-related differences can be explained by the proportion of pensioners of the entire population. An interesting finding is that the higher the proportion of pensioners, the stronger the preference for higher pension spending of the elderlies compared to the preference of the middle-age working population.},
