Welcome on my website!

I am <b>Alexander Dalheimer</b> and I am currently finishing my Master's in Political Science at the University of Cologne. Before I moved to Cologne, I studied Politics & Public Administration at the University of Konstanz and Charles University, Prague.

My research interests focus on democratic representation, political & legislative behavior, party competition and political communication of parties and members of parliament (MPs). Especially, I am interested in how democratic insitutions shape the behavior of voters, legislators, political parties or other social groups. 

My research is characterized by advanced and innovative quantitative research designs. A wide variety of methods from (non-)linear regression, hierarchical and time-series models to machine learning and text-as-data approaches were used in multiple [projects](LINK). I am very interested in developing new methods and measurements and refining existing methodological approaches. Currently, I am further developing the approach of Peterson & Spierling (2018) to measure the degree of polarization based on parliamentary debates. 

On this website, you find information about my [education](https://adalheimer.github.io/education/), [experiences & skills](https://adalheimer.github.io/experience/)) as well as about [projects](https://adalheimer.github.io/projects/), I realized during my studies.
