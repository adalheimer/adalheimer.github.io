Welcome to my website!

I am <b>Alexander Dalheimer</b>, a PhD student in the ERC-funded <a href='https://erc-partisan.github.io'>PARTISAN</a> project, led by <a href='https://www.wagnermarkus.net'>Markus Wagner</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Politics and Administration from the <a href='https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/'>University of Konstanz</a> and a Master's degree in Political Science from the <a href='https://politik.uni-koeln.de/en/'>University of Cologne</a>.

My dissertation investigates the causes of partisan conflict and affective polarization. I explore both micro and macro-level explanations for the increasing animosity between supporters of different parties in many liberal democracies. Specifically, I examine the roles of partisan (meta)perceptions, identity and policy disagreements, the impact of radical right parties, and local party competition. My research has a strong comparative aspect, utilizing data not only from the US but also from Canada and several European countries.

Additionally, I am passionate about quantitative and computational methods. The <a href='https://erc-partisan.github.io'>PARTISAN</a> project allows me to combine original cross-sectional data from 13 countries with survey experiments. Furthermore, my research employs quasi-experimental designs and computational text-as-data methods.
